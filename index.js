                    /* ARITHMETIC PRACTICE*/

// ARITHMETIC OPERATORS = operands (values, varaibles, etc.)
//      operators (+,-,/)
// ex 11 = x + 5



// let students = 30;



// students = students + 1; uncomment one at a time to practice it. 
// students = students -1;
// students = students * 2;
// students = students / 2;
 // students = students ** 2;

 // students = students % 3; this will divide out the number and then give you the remainder. modulos operator


    // AUGMENTED ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
 // - this is a shorter way to use arithmetic. 

    // students += 1; output 31
    //students *=2; output  60
 // students /=2;


 // this is how you increase variable by one. 
 // students ++;
 //students --;


 /* Operator Precedence
 1. parenthesis()
 2. exponents
 3. multiplication & division and modulo
4. addition & subtraction. 
*/

// let result = 1+2*3+4**2; this will come out to 16

// let result = 12 % 5 + 8/2;
// console.log(result);


/* 


USER INPUT PRACTICE
1. EASY WAY- window prompt
2. PRO WAY - html textbox



let username;
 username = window.prompt("whats your user name? ")
this is the easy way.
